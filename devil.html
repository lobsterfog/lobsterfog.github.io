    <h1>Living from the Devil</h1>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"But these impulses may be from below, not from above."</p>
      <p>
        I replied, "They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the Devil's
        child, I will live then from the Devil."

      It's easy to say that we should follow our own nature. That we should be
      true to ourselves and shun the opinions of others. But how does one do
      this in practice?
    </p>

    <p>
      Speaking for myself, I do not hear a voice deep down inside me clamoring
      for some course of action, while my self-conscious mind beats it into
      submission.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, I find that I live my life more or less according to my whims,
      but when I look back it turns out that <em>lots</em> of my decisions were
      encouraged by the opinions of others.
    </p>

    <p>
      What's more, even in the moment, when I can feel others urging me to some
      course of action, it's almost impossible to step outside myself and ask,
      "What do I really want to do?"
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is that there is no "you." Your actions are the results of
      many different brain modules (see <em>Why Buddhism is true</em>) fighting
      for control. Or, to put it another way, there are many "you's." There's
      the "you" that wants to eat that chocolate cake right now because it'll
      taste good. There's the "you" that knows you'll feel sick if you do. And
      there's the "you" that knows that looking <em>worried</em> about your diet
      will seem week an effeminate to your peers. None of these is the real
      "you"—because there is no real "you."
    </p>

    <p>
      When we say we want to listen to our inner voice, what we really mean is
      that we want to <em>ignore</em> the parts of us that responding to social
      pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      So the feeling of listening to your inner voice isn't necessarily one of
      embracing your first thoughts or feelings. You might have very strong
      feelings of embarassment if you show up to a wedding with an ill-fitted
      suit, but that doesn't mean it's the "authentic you." You might have very
      loud thoughts about how terrible you are at your job—but again, just
      because these are immediate and authentic thoughts doesn't mean they're
      right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Listening to your authentic self requires a huge amount of
      self-reflection. It requires examining every thought and feeling and
      deciding whether it's influenced by other people's opinions. And if it
      <em>is</em>, throw it away (this is the hardest part).
    </p>

      This is why I like Emerson's quote above, about "living from the Devil."
      It's a visceral way of trying to figure out if a thought or feeling is
      coming from within or from someone else. Ask yourself, "if I were a
      devil-child, would I be feeling this way?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Back to the cake. Would a demon-spawn want to eat a tasty cake? Sure.
      Would a demon-spawn <em>avoid</em> a tasty cake to maximize their
      long-term health? A smart demon-spawn! Would a demon-spawn feel weak and
      cowardly for avoiding the chocolate cake? Definitely not—you're the
      Devil's kid, who the fuck cares?
    </p>

    <p>Am I saying that we should just be more selfish? Maybe.</p>

    <p>
      If we're trying to encourage the <em>internal</em> "you's" over the
      self-conscious "you's," it's true that we should follow or selfishness, to
      a point. It's a good way to snap us out of the self-conscious loop of
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Am I doing something weird?</li>
      <li>Don't be stupid, who cares what you're doing.</li>
      <li>Do whatever you want</li>
      <li>What do I want?</li>
    </ul>

      Emerson's comment—in my reading—is a statement on moral relativity.
      Emerson says that when your own morals and society's conflict, you should
      follow your own.

      It's easy to confuse selfishness with self-reliance (<a
        href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2020/01/15/the-myth-of-self-reliance/"
        >example</a
      >). Both selfish and self-reliant people are incredibly attuned to those
      inner voices—the ones that emerge from deep within.
